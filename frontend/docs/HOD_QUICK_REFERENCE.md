## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Timetable is Read-Only**: HODs cannot modify subject-faculty mappings. Contact Admin for changes.

2. **Feedback is Anonymous**: No way to identify individual students. This ensures honest feedback.

3. **Real-time Analytics**: Analytics update as students submit. Check anytime for latest data.

4. **Branch-Specific Access**: HODs see only their branch's data (e.g., CSE HOD sees only CSE batches).

5. **Semester Visibility**: Only current year semesters shown (past semesters hidden).

6. **Publish Once**: After publishing, feedback form becomes active for students. Cannot unpublish.
